            I am a recent college graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science.
            I am working to find a job in the industry as a Software Engineer 
            with a focus in 3D game development or full-stack web development. 
            I have absorbed a ton of knowledge from building projects by myself over the 
            years along with courses taken in school to advance my programming ability to 
            new heights. I aim to find a good job where I can take my

            positively on whatever it is I am doing.
